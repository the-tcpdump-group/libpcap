.SH NAME
pcap-filter \- packet filter syntax
.br
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.BR pcap_compile (3PCAP)
is used to compile a string into a filter program.
The resulting filter program can then be applied to
some stream of packets to determine which packets will be supplied to
.BR pcap_loop (3PCAP),
.BR pcap_dispatch (3PCAP),
.BR pcap_next (3PCAP),
or
.BR pcap_next_ex (3PCAP).
.LP
The \fIfilter expression\fP consists of one or more
.IR primitives .
Primitives usually consist of an
.I id
(a name, a number or something slightly more complex, such as a CIDR prefix)
preceded by one or more qualifiers.
There are three
different kinds of qualifier:
.IP \fIproto\fP
.I proto
qualifiers restrict the match to a particular protocol.
(This should not be confused with the
.B proto
type qualifier below.)
Possible
protocols are:
.BR ether ,
.BR link ,
.BR wlan ,
.BR ip ,
.BR ip6 ,
.BR arp ,
.BR tcp ,
.BR udp ,
.BR sctp ,
.BR iso ,
.BR isis ,
.BR rarp ,
.BR decnet ,
.BR fddi ,
.BR tr ,
.B ppp
and
.BR slip .
E.g., `\fBether src\fP foo', `\fBarp net\fP 128.3', `\fBtcp port\fP 21',
`\fBip proto\fP ospf', `\fBether proto\fP 0x88CC',
`\fBudp portrange\fP 7000-7009', `\fBwlan addr2\fP 0:2:3:4:5:6'.
If there is no
.I proto
qualifier, all protocols consistent with the type are assumed.
E.g., `\fBsrc\fP foo' means `\fB(ip6 or ip or arp or rarp) src\fP foo',
`\fBproto\fP tcp' means `\fB(ip6 or ip) proto\fP tcp'
`\fBnet\fP bar' means `\fB(ip6 or ip or arp or rarp) net\fP bar' and
`\fBport\fP 53' means `\fB(tcp or udp or sctp) port\fP 53'
(note that these examples use invalid syntax to illustrate the principle).
.IP \fIdir\fP
.I dir
qualifiers specify a particular transfer direction to and/or from
.IR id .
Possible directions are
.BR src ,
.BR dst ,
.BR "src or dst" ,
.BR "src and dst" ,
.BR ra ,
.BR ta ,
.BR addr1 ,
.BR addr2 ,
.BR addr3 ,
and
.BR addr4 .
E.g., `\fBsrc\fP foo', `\fBdst net\fP 128.3', `\fBsrc or dst port\fP ftp-data'.
If
there is no dir qualifier, `\fBsrc or dst\fP' is assumed.
The
.BR ra ,
.BR ta ,
.BR addr1 ,
.BR addr2 ,
.BR addr3 ,
and
.B addr4
qualifiers are only valid for IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN link layers.
.IP \fItype\fP
.I type
qualifiers say what kind of thing the id name or number refers to.
Possible types are
.BR host ,
.BR net ,
.BR \%proto ,
.BR port ,
.BR \%portrange ,
.B \%protochain
and
.B \%gateway.
E.g., `\fBhost\fP foo', `\fBnet\fP 128.3', `\fBport\fP 20', `\fBportrange\fP 6000-6008',
`\fBproto \fP 17'.
If there is no type
qualifier,
.B host
is assumed.
.LP
In primitives that follow this pattern each qualifier kind may be present at
most once, and if more than one kind is present, any
.I proto
qualifier must be the first qualifier and any
.I type
qualifier must be the last qualifier, for example, `\fBtcp dst port\fP 80'.
Also not all combinations of these qualifier kinds are valid syntax.  Some
make no sense in network protocols space, for example:
.B "ether port"
(Ethernet header has no ports),
.B "tcp net"
(TCP header does not have layer 3 fields),
.B "dst proto"
(in a protocol header the same protocol applies to both the source and the
destination), and so on.  Some other combinations are not valid syntax because
they are not implemented, even though hypothetically could make sense, for
example:
.BR "iso net" ,
.B "aarp host"
and so on.
.LP
[\fBfddi\fP is actually an alias for \fBether\fP; the parser treats them
identically as meaning ``the data link level used on the specified
network interface''.  FDDI headers contain Ethernet-like source
and destination addresses, and often contain Ethernet-like packet
types, so you can filter on these FDDI fields just as with the
analogous Ethernet fields.
FDDI headers also contain other fields,
but you cannot name them explicitly in a filter expression.
Similarly, \fBtr\fP and \fBwlan\fP are aliases for \fBether\fP; the
statements about FDDI headers also apply to Token Ring and 802.11 wireless
LAN headers.  The same stands for the
.BR link ,
.B ppp
and
.B slip
keywords.]
.LP
For IEEE 802.11 headers, the destination address is the DA field and the
source address is the SA field.  For both ARP and RARP headers, the
destination address is the TPA (Target Protocol Address) field and the
source address is the SPA (Sender Protocol Address) field.
.LP
In addition to the above, there are some special `primitive' keywords
that don't follow the pattern (for example:
.BR broadcast ,
.BR multicast ,
.BR inbound ,
.BR outbound ,
.BR ifindex ,
.BR llc ,
.BR vlan ,
.BR mpls ,
.BR less ,
.BR greater ),
packet data accessors and relations of two arithmetic expressions.
All of these are described below.
.LP
More complex filter expressions are built up by using the words
.BR and ,
.B or
and
.B not
(or equivalently: `\fB&&\fP', `\fB||\fP' and `\fB!\fP' respectively)
to combine primitives.
E.g., `\fBhost\fP foo \fBand not port\fP ftp \fBand not port\fP ftp-data'.
To save typing, identical qualifier lists can be omitted.
E.g.,
`\fBtcp dst port\fP ftp \fBor\fP ftp-data \fBor\fP domain' is exactly the same as
`\fBtcp dst port\fP ftp \fBor tcp dst port\fP ftp-data \fBor tcp dst port\fP domain'.
.SH PRIMITIVES
.IP "\fBhost \fIhostnameaddr\fR"
True if the source or the destination ARP/IPv4/IPv6/RARP address of the packet is
.IR hostnameaddr .
May be qualified with a specific protocol
.RB ( arp ,
.BR ip ,
.BR ip6 ,
.BR rarp )
and/or a different direction
.RB ( src ,
.BR dst ,
.BR "src and dst" ),
in the latter case the
.B host
keyword is optional.  For example,
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBip src \fIhostnameaddr\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
for Ethernet-like link-layer types is equivalent to
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBether proto \\\fRip \fBand ip src host \fIhostnameaddr\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
.IP
.I hostnameaddr
may be either an address or a name.  If it is a name, the name must resolve
to at least one IPv4 address for
.BR "arp host" ,
.B "ip host"
and
.BR "rarp host" ,
at least one IPv6 address for
.B "ip6 host"
and at least one IPv4/IPv6 address for
.BR "host" .
.IP
When not qualified with a protocol, this primitive matches all protocols that
make sense for the address families of the specified/resolved addresses.  For
example, for a name that resolves only to an IPv6 address
.B "arp host"
returns an error, but
.B host
is valid and means IPv6;
likewise, for a name that resolves only to an IPv4 address
.B "ip6 host"
returns an error, but
.B host
is valid and means ARP/IPv4/RARP.
.IP
Whether qualified with a protocol or not, this primitive evaluates to true if
the name resolves to more than one address and at least one of the addresses
matches the packet.
.IP "\fBether host \fIethernameaddr\fP"
True if the source or the destination Ethernet/802.11/IPFC/ATM LANE/FDDI/Token Ring
address of the packet is
.IR ethernameaddr .
May be qualified with a different direction
.RB ( src ,
.BR dst ,
.BR "src and dst" ),
in which case the
.B host
keyword is optional.
.IP
\fIethernameaddr\fP
may be either a name from /etc/ethers or a numerical MAC address of the
form "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx", "xx.xx.xx.xx.xx.xx", "xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx",
"xxxx.xxxx.xxxx" or "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
where each "x" is a hex digit (0-9, a-f, or A-F).
.IP "\fBgateway\fP \fIhost\fP"
True if the packet used \fIhost\fP as a gateway.
I.e., the source or the destination Ethernet-like address is
.I host
but neither the source nor the destination ARP/IPv4/RARP address is
.IR host .
This primitive is valid only for the same link-layer types as the
.B "ether host"
primitive above.  May be qualified with a specific protocol
.RB ( arp ,
.BR ip ,
.BR rarp ).
For example,
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBip gateway \fIhost\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
is equivalent to
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBether host \fIethernameaddr \fBand not ip host \fIhostnameaddr\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
which can be used with either names or numbers for
.I hostnameaddr
and
.IR ethernameaddr .
.IP
\fIHost\fP must be a name and
must be found both by the machine's host-name-to-IP-address resolution
mechanisms (host name file, DNS, NIS, etc.) and by the machine's
host-name-to-Ethernet-address resolution mechanism (/etc/ethers, etc.).
.IP "\fBnet \fInetnameaddr\fR"
True if the source or the destination ARP/IPv4/IPv6/RARP address of the packet
belongs to the specified network.  May be qualified with a specific protocol
.RB ( arp ,
.BR ip ,
.BR ip6 ,
.BR rarp )
and/or a different direction
.RB ( src ,
.BR dst ,
.BR "src and dst" ),
in the latter case the
.B net
keyword remains mandatory.
.I netnameaddr
may be either a name from the networks database
(/etc/networks, etc.) or a network number.
.IP
An IPv4 network number can be written as a dotted quad (e.g., 192.168.1.0),
dotted triple (e.g., 192.168.1), dotted pair (e.g, 172.16), or single
number (e.g., 10); the netmask is 255.255.255.255 (/32) for a dotted quad
(which means that it's really a host match), 255.255.255.0 (/24) for a dotted
triple, 255.255.0.0 (/16) for a dotted pair, or 255.0.0.0 (/8) for a single number.
An IPv6 network number must be written out fully; the netmask is
ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff (/128), so in this primitive IPv6
"network" matches are really always host matches.  For an actual IPv6 network
match see the `\fBnet \fInetaddr\fR/\fIlen\fR' primitive below.
.IP "\fBnet \fInetaddr\fR \fBmask \fInetmask\fR"
True if the source or the destination ARP/IPv4/RARP address of the packet
belongs to \fInetaddr\fR with the specified \fInetmask\fR.  May be qualified
with a specific protocol
.RB ( arp ,
.BR ip ,
.BR rarp )
and/or a different direction
.RB ( src ,
.BR dst ,
.BR "src and dst" ),
in the latter case the
.B net
keyword remains mandatory.  In this implementation this primitive does not
support IPv6 networks.
.IP
Both
.I netaddr
and
.I netmask
use the IPv4 network number notation described above, except the "single
number" form is not valid in this primitive.  For example,
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBnet \fP192.168 \fBmask \fP255.255\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
is equivalent to
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBnet \fP192.168.0.0 \fBmask \fP255.255.0.0\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
.IP
The
.I netmask
can represent any 32-bit value, which is why the
`\fBnet \fI\%netaddr\fR/\fIlen\fR' primitive below is usually a better fit for
use cases that require the value to be strictly one of the 33 CIDR masks (from
/0 to /32).
.IP "\fBnet \fInetaddr\fR/\fIlen\fR"
True if the source or the destination ARP/IPv4/IPv6/RARP address of the packet
belongs to
.I netaddr
where the bit-length of the network mask equals
.I len
(in other words, the address belongs to the specified CIDR prefix).  May be
qualified with a specific protocol
.RB ( arp ,
.BR ip ,
.BR ip6 ,
.BR rarp )
and/or a different direction
.RB ( src ,
.BR dst ,
.BR "src and dst" ),
in the latter case the
.B net
keyword is optional.
.IP
For IPv4,
.I len
is an integer between 0 and 32 (both inclusive) and
.I netaddr
is the same as the above.  For IPv6,
.I len
is an integer between 0 and 128 (both inclusive) and
.I netaddr
is an IPv6 address.  For the latter zero compression notation
.RB ( :: )
is valid, but IPv4-mapped notation
.RB ( x:x:x:x:x:x:d.d.d.d )
is not.  For both IPv4 and IPv6 the maximum value of
.I len
is equivalent to a host match and the 0 value (which implies an all-zeroes
value of
.IR netaddr )
matches any address.  In the latter case this primitive reduces to matching
the specified (or implied) protocols only.
.IP "\fBport \fIportnamenum\fR"
True if the source or the destination TCP/UDP/SCTP port of an IPv4/IPv6 packet
is
.IR portnamenum .
For IPv4 this also implies that the packet is the first fragment or is not
fragmented.  May be qualified with a specific layer 4 protocol
.RB ( tcp ,
.BR udp ,
.BR sctp )
or a different direction
.RB ( src ,
.BR dst ,
.BR "src and dst" ),
in the latter case the
.B port
keyword remains mandatory.  Cannot be qualified with a specific layer 3
protocol (IPv4/IPv6) in the same primitive, but can be trivially combined with
other primitives to achieve the required effect, for example:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBip and tcp dst port \fP80\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
.IP
The \fIportnamenum\fP can be a number or a name used in /etc/services (see
.BR services (5)).
If a name is used, both the port
number and protocol are checked.
If a number or ambiguous name is used,
only the port number is checked (e.g., `\fBdst port\fR 513' will print both
tcp/login traffic and udp/who traffic, and `\fBport\fR domain' will print
both tcp/domain and udp/domain traffic).
.IP "\fBportrange \fIportnamenum1-portnamenum2\fR"
This is a more generic form of the above: true if the port number in the
packet is between
.I portnamenum1
and
.I portnamenum2
(both inclusive), everything else holds the same meaning.
In this predicate
.I portnamenum1
and
.I portnamenum2
can be specified in either order.  If the two values are equal, this primitive
has the same effect as the
.B port
primitive above.
.IP "\fBless \fIlength\fR"
True if the packet has a length less than or equal to \fIlength\fP.
This is equivalent to:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBlen <= \fIlength\fP
.fi
.in -.5i
.IP "\fBgreater \fIlength\fR"
True if the packet has a length greater than or equal to \fIlength\fP.
This is equivalent to:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBlen >= \fIlength\fP
.fi
.in -.5i
.IP "\fBip proto \fIprotocol\fR"
True if the packet is an IPv4 packet of protocol type \fIprotocol\fP.
\fIProtocol\fP can be a number or one of the names recognized by
.BR getprotobyname (3),
for example:
.BR ah ,
.BR esp ,
.B eigrp
(only in Linux with glibc, FreeBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, and macOS),
.BR icmp ,
.BR igmp ,
.B igrp
(only in Haiku and OpenBSD),
.BR pim ,
.BR sctp ,
.BR tcp ,
.B udp
or
.BR vrrp .
Note that most of these example identifiers
are also keywords and must be escaped via backslash (\\).
Note that this primitive does not chase the protocol header chain.
.IP
Typically
.BR getprotobyname (3)
parses the
.IR \%/etc/protocols
file to translate protocol names to numbers, and the
.B "getent protocols"
command lists the protocols recognized by the function.  This is not entirely
so in AIX (which does not have the command), Haiku (which has the file at
.IR \%/system/data/network/protocols
and does not have the command), on Linux with musl libc (which hard-codes the
list of protocols) and on hosts that use a network database to resolve
protocol names to numbers (see
.BR nsswitch.conf (5)).
If a protocol name fails to translate to a number, this version of libpcap
will treat the filter expression as invalid.
.IP "\fBcarp\fR, \fBvrrp\fR"
Abbreviations for:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBip proto\fR 112
.fi
.in -.5i
.IP "\fBicmp\fR"
Abbreviation for:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBip proto\fR 1
.fi
.in -.5i
.IP "\fBigmp\fR"
Abbreviation for:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBip proto\fR 2
.fi
.in -.5i
.IP "\fBigrp\fR"
Abbreviation for:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBip proto \fIigrpval\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
where
.I igrpval
is 88 on DragonFly BSD, FreeBSD and macOS, and 9 on all other OSes.  This
abbreviation should not be used in portable applications and may be removed
in future.
.IP "\fBip6 proto \fIprotocol\fR"
True if the packet is an IPv6 packet of protocol type \fIprotocol\fP.
(See `\fBip proto\fP' above for the meaning of \fIprotocol\fR.)
Note that the IPv6 variant of ICMP uses a different protocol number, named
.B \%ipv6-icmp
in AIX, FreeBSD, illumos, Haiku, GNU/Hurd, Linux, macOS, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
Solaris and Windows.
Note that this primitive does not chase the protocol header chain.
.IP "\fBicmp6\fR"
Abbreviation for:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBip6 proto\fR 58
.fi
.in -.5i
.IP "\fBproto \fIprotocol\fR"
True if the packet is an IPv4 or IPv6 packet of protocol type
\fIprotocol\fP.  (See `\fBip proto\fP' above for the meaning of
\fIprotocol\fP.)  Note that this primitive does not chase the protocol
header chain.
.IP  "\fBah\fR, \fBesp\fR, \fBpim\fR, \fBsctp\fR, \fBtcp\fR, \fBudp\fR"
Abbreviations for:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBproto \\\fIprotocol\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
where \fIprotocol\fR is one of the above protocols.
.IP "\fBip6 protochain \fIprotocol\fR"
True if the packet is IPv6 packet,
and contains protocol header with type \fIprotocol\fR
in its protocol header chain.
(See `\fBip proto\fP' above for the meaning of \fIprotocol\fP.)
For example,
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBip6 protochain\fR 6
.fi
.in -.5i
matches any IPv6 packet with TCP protocol header in the protocol header chain.
The packet may contain, for example,
authentication header, routing header, or hop-by-hop option header,
between IPv6 header and TCP header.
The BPF code emitted by this primitive is complex and
cannot be optimized by the BPF optimizer code, and is not supported by
filter engines in the kernel, so this can be somewhat slow, and may
cause more packets to be dropped.
.IP "\fBip protochain \fIprotocol\fR"
Equivalent to \fBip6 protochain \fIprotocol\fR, but this is for IPv4.
(See `\fBip proto\fP' above for the meaning of \fIprotocol\fP.)
.IP "\fBprotochain \fIprotocol\fR"
True if the packet is an IPv4 or IPv6 packet of protocol type
\fIprotocol\fP.  (See `\fBip proto\fP' above for the meaning of
\fIprotocol\fP.)  Note that this primitive chases the protocol
header chain.
.IP "\fBether broadcast\fR"
True if the destination Ethernet/802.11/IPFC/ARCnet/ATM LANE/FDDI/Token Ring address of
the packet is the broadcast address (e.g.
.B FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
for Ethernet).  The
.B ether
keyword is optional.
.IP "\fBip broadcast\fR"
True if the packet is an IPv4 packet with the host part of the destination
address being either all-ones or all-zeroes.  This primitive requires to
specify the netmask, which cannot be done in the filter expression; the only
way to specify a netmask is via the
.B \%netmask
argument of the
.BR \%pcap_compile ()
function.  If a netmask has not been specified, an attempt to compile a
filter expression with this primitive will return an error.
.IP
Note that this primitive ignores the network part of the destination address,
thus it can match more packets than expected, especially if the interface has
multiple IPv4 addresses with different netmasks.  For example, if the
interface has addresses 10.1.2.100/29 and 192.168.202.200/24 configured and
the
.B \%netmask
argument corresponds to the first address, its value will be
.BR \%0xFFFFFFF8
and the host mask value will be
.BR \%0x00000007 .
This will match the expected two addresses in the first prefix (10.1.2.96 and
10.1.2.103), as well as 64 addresses in the second prefix (192.168.202.0,
192.168.202.7, 192.168.202.8, 192.168.202.15, 192.168.202.16 and so on), as
well as any other IPv4 address with the lowest 3 bits being all-ones or
all-zeroes (for example: 10.73.74.151, 192.168.50.63, 172.19.0.128) -- in
other words, 25% of the complete IPv4 address space.  This is why in use
cases that require more precision it would be better to match the required
address(es) explicitly, for example:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBip dst host 10.1.2.96 or 10.1.2.103\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
.IP "\fBether multicast\fR"
True if the destination Ethernet/802.11/IPFC/ARCnet/ATM LANE/FDDI/Token Ring address of
the packet is a multicast address (e.g.
.B "\%ether[0] & 1 != 0"
for Ethernet).  The
.B ether
keyword is optional.
.IP "\fBip multicast\fR"
True if the packet is an IPv4 multicast packet.
.IP "\fBip6 multicast\fR"
True if the packet is an IPv6 multicast packet.
.IP  "\fBether proto \fIprotocol\fR"
True if the packet is of ether type \fIprotocol\fR.
\fIProtocol\fP can be a number or one of the names:

Note these identifiers (except \fBlldp\fP, \fBloopback\fP and \fBslow\fP)
are also keywords and must be escaped via backslash (\\).
.IP
[In the case of FDDI (e.g., `\fBfddi proto \\arp\fR'), Token Ring
(e.g., `\fBtr proto \\arp\fR'), and IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (e.g.,
`\fBwlan proto \\arp\fR'), for most of those protocols, the
protocol identification comes from the 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC)
header, which is usually layered on top of the FDDI, Token Ring, or
802.11 header.
.IP
When filtering for most protocol identifiers on FDDI, Token Ring, or
802.11, the filter checks only the protocol ID field of an LLC header
in so-called SNAP format with an Organizational Unit Identifier (OUI) of
0x000000, for encapsulated Ethernet; it doesn't check whether the packet
is in SNAP format with an OUI of 0x000000.

.IP
The arithmetic expressions and packet data accessors below implement all of
these and many other things much better, so this primitive will be removed in
a future release and should not be used in applications that require forward
compatibility.
.SH ARITHMETIC EXPRESSIONS
Arithmetic expressions are the operands of a relational operator in a
relation of the following form:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fIexpr1 relop expr2\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
This evaluates to true if and only if the relation holds.
.I relop
(the relational operator) is one of
.RB { > ,
.BR < ,
.BR >= ,
.BR <= ,
.BR = ,
.BR == ,
.BR != }
(where
.B =
means the same as
.BR == ).
Each of \fIexpr1\fR and \fIexpr2\fR is an arithmetic expression composed of
integer constants (expressed in standard C syntax), the common arithmetic and
bitwise binary operations
.RB { + ,
.BR - ,
.BR * ,
.BR / ,
.BR % ,
.BR & ,
.BR | ,
.BR ^ ,
.BR << ,
.BR >> },
a length operator, and packet data accessors.  All arithmetic expressions
regardless of the complexity and composition resolve to an integer value.
Note that all comparisons are unsigned, so that, for example, both 0x80000000
and 0xffffffff are > 0.
.LP
Note that 32-bit octal integer constants in the [010000000000 .. 037777777777]
interval, which includes 75% of all 32-bit integers, are interpreted as MAC-48
addresses when prepended with a single zero (e.g., 012345670123 means
01:23:45:67:01:23).  To disambiguate the expression, prepend such an octal
number with more zeroes (0012345670123) or represent the same value using a
decimal (1402433619) or hexadecimal (0x53977053) number.
.LP
The
.B %
and
.B ^
operators are currently only supported for filtering in the kernel on
particular operating systems (for example: FreeBSD, Linux with 3.7 and later
kernels, NetBSD); on all other systems (for example: AIX, Hurd, illumos, Solaris,
OpenBSD), if
those operators are used, filtering will be done in user mode, which
will increase the overhead of capturing packets and may cause more
packets to be dropped.
.LP
The length operator, indicated by the keyword \fBlen\fP, gives the
length of the packet.
.SH PACKET DATA ACCESSORS
To use the packet data in an arithmetic expression, use the following syntax:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fIproto\fB [ \fIexpr\fB : \fIsize\fB ]\fR

.in -.5i
.I Proto
is one of
.BR arp ,
.BR atalk ,
.BR carp ,
.BR decnet ,
.BR ether ,
.BR fddi ,
.BR icmp ,
.BR icmp6 ,
.BR igmp ,
.BR igrp ,
.BR ip ,
.BR ip6 ,
.BR lat ,
.BR link ,
.BR mopdl ,
.BR moprc ,
.BR pim ,
.BR ppp ,
.BR radio ,
.BR rarp ,
.BR sca ,
.BR sctp ,
.BR slip ,
.BR tcp ,
.BR tr ,
.BR udp ,
.B vrrp
or
.BR wlan ,
and
indicates the protocol layer for the index operation.
.RB ( ether ,
.BR fddi ,
.BR link ,
.BR ppp ,
.BR slip ,
.B tr
and
.BR wlan
all refer to the
link layer, \fBradio\fR refers to the "radio header" added to some
802.11 captures.)
Note that \fBtcp\fR, \fBudp\fR and other upper-layer protocol types only
apply to IPv4, not IPv6 (this will be fixed in the future).
The byte offset, relative to the indicated protocol layer, is
given by \fIexpr\fR, which can be an integer constant or any other valid
arithmetic expression.
\fISize\fR is optional and indicates the number of bytes in the
field of interest; it can be either one, two, or four, and defaults to one;
also it must be one of these valid integer constants only and cannot be a
more complex expression.

For example, `\fBether[\fP0\fB] &\fP 1 \fB!=\fP 0' catches all multicast traffic.
The expression `\fBip[\fP0\fB] &\fP 0xf \fB!=\fP 5'
catches all IPv4 packets with options.
The expression
`\fBip[\fP6:2\fB] &\fP 0x1fff \fB=\fP 0'
catches only unfragmented IPv4 datagrams and frag zero of fragmented
IPv4 datagrams.
This check is implicitly applied to the
.BR tcp ,
.BR udp ,
.BR icmp ,
.BR sctp ,
.BR igmp ,
.BR pim ,
.BR igrp ,
.BR vrrp
and
.BR carp
index operations.
For instance, \fBtcp[\fP0\fB]\fP always means the first
byte of the TCP \fIheader\fP, and never means the first byte of an
intervening fragment.
.SH NAMED VALUES

The following TCP flags field values are available: \fBtcp-fin\fP,
\fBtcp-syn\fP, \fBtcp-rst\fP, \fBtcp-push\fP,
\fBtcp-ack\fP, \fBtcp-urg\fP, \fBtcp-ece\fP,

.SH COMPOUND EXPRESSIONS
Primitives and relations may be combined using:
.LP
Parentheses.
.LP
Negation (`\fB!\fP' or `\fBnot\fP').
.LP
Concatenation (`\fB&&\fP' or `\fBand\fP').
.LP
Alternation (`\fB||\fP' or `\fBor\fP').
.LP
Negation has the highest precedence.
Alternation and concatenation have equal precedence and associate
left to right.
.LP
For primitives, if an identifier is given without a keyword, the most recent
keyword is assumed.  For example,
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBnot host\fP vs \fBand\fR ace
.fi
.in -.5i
is short for
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBnot host\fP vs \fBand host\fR ace
.fi
.in -.5i
which should not be confused with
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBnot (host \fPvs\fB and host \fPace\fB)\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
.SH PROTOCOL NAMES IN VARIOUS CONTEXTS
The table below shows which protocol names can be used in which contexts of
the currently implemented syntax.  The "name" column contains a protocol name,
which can be used as a keyword and/or as an ID for the
.B proto
case of the
.I type
qualifier kind.
.LP
For keywords: if the keyword is an alias, the "K/see" column refers to the
main keyword; the "K/abbr" column tells whether the keyword can be used as an
abbreviation (that is, if the keyword is the only contents of a primitive, it
means a more complex expression); the "K/PDA" column tells whether the keyword
can be used in a packet data accessor; the "K/pqual" column tells whether the
keyword can be used as a case of the
.I proto
qualifier kind.
.LP
For IDs: the "ID/tqual" column shows the valid context(s).

`\fBip6 proto\fP'
should chase header chain, but at this moment it does not.
`\fBip6 protochain\fP'
is supplied for this behavior.  For example, to match IPv6 fragments:
`\fBip6 protochain\fP 44'
.LP
Arithmetic expression against transport layer headers, like \fBtcp[0]\fP,
does not work against IPv6 packets.
It only looks at IPv4 packets.
.LP
The
.B sio
and
.B hsio
keywords do not test whether the packet is an MSU packet.  The
.BR dpc ,
.BR opc ,

and
.B hsls
keywords do not test whether the packet is an MTP3 packet.
.LP
For ARP and RARP the current implementation assumes IPv4 over Ethernet and may
incorrectly match packets that have a different combination of protocol and
hardware.
