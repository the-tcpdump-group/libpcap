 * In pre-3.0 kernels, the tp_vlan_tci field is set to whatever the

 * distinguish between them.
 *
 * In 3.0 and later kernels, if there's a VLAN tag present, the tp_vlan_tci

 * in the tp_status field, otherwise the tp_vlan_tci field is set to 0 and

 *
 * With a pre-3.0 kernel, we cannot distinguish between packets with no
 * VLAN tag and packets on VLAN 0, so we will mishandle some packets, and
 * there's nothing we can do about that.
 *
 * So, on those systems, which never set the TP_STATUS_VLAN_VALID flag, we
 * continue the behavior of earlier libpcaps, wherein we treated packets
 * with a VLAN tag of 0 as being packets without a VLAN tag rather than packets
 * on VLAN 0.  We do this by treating packets with a tp_vlan_tci of 0 and
 * with the TP_STATUS_VLAN_VALID flag not set in tp_status as not having
 * VLAN tags.  This does the right thing on 3.0 and later kernels, and
 * continues the old unfixably-imperfect behavior on pre-3.0 kernels.

 *
 * On Fedora 9, with a 2.6.26.3-29 kernel, my Zydas stick, at
 * least, has a "wmaster0" device and a "wlan0" device; the
 * latter is the one with the IP address.  Both show up in
 * "tcpdump -D" output.  Capturing on the wmaster0 device
 * captures with 802.11 headers.
 *
 * airmon-ng searches through /sys/class/net for devices named
 * monN, starting with mon0; as soon as one *doesn't* exist,
 * it chooses that as the monitor device name.  If the "iw"
 * command exists, it does
 *
 *    iw dev {if_name} interface add {monif_name} type monitor
 *
 * where {monif_name} is the monitor device.  It then (sigh) sleeps
 * .1 second, and then configures the device up.  Otherwise, if
 * /sys/class/ieee80211/{phydev_name}/add_iface is a file, it writes
 * {mondev_name}, without a newline, to that file, and again (sigh)
 * sleeps .1 second, and then iwconfig's that device into monitor
 * mode and configures it up.  Otherwise, you can't do monitor mode.
 *
 * All these devices are "glued" together by having the
 * /sys/class/net/{if_name}/phy80211 links pointing to the same
 * place, so, given a wmaster, wlan, or mon device, you can
 * find the other devices by looking for devices with
 * the same phy80211 link.
 *
 * To turn monitor mode off, delete the monitor interface,
 * either with
 *
 *    iw dev {monif_name} interface del
 *
 * or by sending {monif_name}, with no NL, down
 * /sys/class/ieee80211/{phydev_name}/remove_iface
 *
 * Note: if you try to create a monitor device named "monN", and
 * there's already a "monN" device, it fails, as least with
 * the netlink interface (which is what iw uses), with a return
 * value of -ENFILE.  (Return values are negative errnos.)  We

		 *
		 *	I've checked into the libpcap and tcpdump CVS tree

		 * ARP hardware" are supposed to mean (link-layer
		 * header type?  Physical network type?), so it's
		 * not exactly clear why the ARPHRD_FC* types exist

		 *
		 * For now, we map them to DLT_FC_2, and provide an

	 * place, so, given a wmaster, wlan, or mon device, you can
	 * find the other devices by looking for devices with
	 * the same phy80211 link.
	 *
	 * To turn monitor mode off, delete the monitor interface,
