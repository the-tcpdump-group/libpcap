Libpcap can be built either with the configure script and `make`, or
with CMake and any build system supported by CMake.

To build libpcap with the configure script and `make`:

* If you build from a git clone rather than from a release archive,
run `./autogen.sh` (a shell script). The autogen.sh script will
build the `configure` and `config.h.in` files.

On some system, you may need to set the `AUTORECONF` variable, like:
`AUTORECONF=autoreconf-2.69 ./autogen.sh`
to select the `autoreconf` version you want to use.

* Run `./configure` (a shell script).  The configure script will
determine your system attributes and generate an appropriate `Makefile`
from `Makefile.in`.  The configure script has a number of options to
control the configuration of libpcap; `./configure --help` will show
them.

* Next, run `make`.  If everything goes well, you can
`su` to root and run `make install`.  However, you need not install
libpcap if you just want to build tcpdump; just make sure the tcpdump
and libpcap directory trees have the same parent directory.

On OpenBSD, you may need to set, before the `make`, the `AUTOCONF_VERSION`
variable like:
`AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69 make`

To build libpcap with CMake and the build system of your choice, from
the command line:

* Create a build directory into which CMake will put the build files it
generates; CMake does not work as well with builds done in the source
code directory as does the configure script.  The build directory may be
created as a subdirectory of the source directory or as a directory
outside the source directory.

* Change to the build directory and run CMake with the path from the
build directory to the source directory as an argument.  The `-G` flag
can be used to select the CMake "generator" appropriate for the build
system you're using; various `-D` flags can be used to control the
configuration of libpcap.

* Run the build tool.  If everything goes well, you can `su` to root and
run the build tool with the `install` target.  Building tcpdump from a
libpcap in a build directory is not supported.

An `uninstall` target is supported with both `./configure` and CMake.

***DO NOT*** run the build as root; there is no need to do so, running
anything as root that doesn't need to be run as root increases the risk
of damaging your system, and running the build as root will put files in
the build directory that are owned by root and that probably cannot be
overwritten, removed, or replaced except by root, which could cause
permission errors in subsequent builds.

If configure says:

    configure: warning: cannot determine packet capture interface
    configure: warning: (see INSTALL.md file for more info)

or CMake says:

    cannot determine packet capture interface

    (see the INSTALL.md file for more info)

then your system either does not support packet capture or your system
does support packet capture but libpcap does not support that
particular type.  If your system uses a
packet capture not supported by libpcap, please send us patches; don't
forget to include an autoconf fragment suitable for use in
`configure.ac`.

It is possible to override the default packet capture type with the
`--with-pcap` option to `./configure` or the `-DPCAP_TYPE` option to
CMake, although the circumstances where this works are limited.  One
possible reason to do that would be to force a supported packet capture
type in the case where the configure or CMake scripts fails to detect
it.

You will need a C99 compiler to build libpcap. The configure script
will abort if your compiler is not C99 compliant. If this happens, use
the generally available GNU C compiler (GCC) or Clang.

You will need either Flex 2.5.31 or later, or a version of Lex
compatible with it (if any exist), to build libpcap.  The configure
script will abort if there isn't any such program; CMake fails if Flex
or Lex cannot be found, but doesn't ensure that it's compatible with
Flex 2.5.31 or later.  If you have an older version of Flex, or don't
have a compatible version of Lex, the current version of Flex is
available [here](https://github.com/westes/flex).

You will need either Bison, Berkeley YACC, or a version of YACC
compatible with them (if any exist), to build libpcap.  The configure
script will abort if there isn't any such program; CMake fails if Bison
or some form of YACC cannot be found, but doesn't ensure that it's
compatible with Bison or Berkeley YACC.  If you don't have any such
program, the current version of Bison can be found
[here](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bison/) and the current version of
Berkeley YACC can be found [here](https://invisible-island.net/byacc/).

Sometimes the stock C compiler does not interact well with Flex and
Bison. The list of problems includes undefined references for alloca(3).
You can get around this by installing GCC.
