 * This is fun.
 *
 * In older BSD systems, socket addresses were fixed-length, and
 * "sizeof (struct sockaddr)" gave the size of the structure.
 * All addresses fit within a "struct sockaddr".
 *
 * In newer BSD systems, the socket address is variable-length, and
 * there's an "sa_len" field giving the length of the structure;
 * this allows socket addresses to be longer than 2 bytes of family
 * and 14 bytes of data.
 *
 * Some commercial UNIXes use the old BSD scheme, some use the RFC 2553
 * variant of the old BSD scheme (with "struct sockaddr_storage" rather
 * than "struct sockaddr"), and some use the new BSD scheme.
 *
 * GNU libc uses neither scheme, but has an "SA_LEN()" macro that
 * determines the size based on the address family.
