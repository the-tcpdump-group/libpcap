 * On Windows, snprintf(), with that name and with C99 behavior - i.e.,
 * guaranteeing that the formatted string is null-terminated - didn't

 * only _snprintf(), which *doesn't* guarantee that the string is
 * null-terminated if it is truncated due to the buffer being too
 * small.  We therefore can't just define snprintf to be _snprintf
 * and define vsnprintf to be _vsnprintf, as we're relying on null-
 * termination of strings in all cases.
 *
 * We also want to allow this to be built with versions of Visual Studio
 * prior to VS 2015, so we can't rely on snprintf() being present.
 *
 * And we want to make sure that, if we support plugins in the future,
 * a routine with C99 snprintf() behavior will be available to them.
 * We also don't want it to collide with the C library snprintf() if
 * there is one.
 *
 * So we make pcap_snprintf() and pcap_vsnprintf() available, either by
 * #defining them to be snprintf or vsnprintf, respectively, or by
 * defining our own versions and exporting them.
